# Agile Project-Estimator
A excel spreadsheet for preparing detailed estimates of software projects

This worksheet performs the following:

* Represents tasks in terms of complexity

* Measures tasks using fibonacci numbers, higher numbers mean more complexity and more uncertainty

* Increases complexity of a given task if 'test tax' is applied

* Adjusts weighted points if a task is already partially completed

* Calculates upper, lower and mid range time estimates in days for each task

* Calculates sprints required for all tasks

* Calculates sprints remaining for all tasks
 
* Configurable number of developers variable

* Configurable sprint length (default 10 working days)

* Configurable points to days mapping
